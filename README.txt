This is a hangman game built in java which makes a GET request for a random word from the internet and lets the user solve the puzzle. 
This is a command line based game which users ASCII graphics as an interface. There is a .txt file called through a symlink which
acts as the GUI builder and I've had mixed results getting it to function properly. Otherwise, the code acts as it should.
